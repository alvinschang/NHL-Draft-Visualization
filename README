This is a visualization of the NHL Draft's first round from 1990 to 2011.

It is written in Processing.

This code should run, as is, except you need to create the font for the file. You can do that in Processing (http://processing.org). Open the file in Processing, go to 'Tools' and select 'Create Font.' There you should create 'Helvetica Neue' size 48. It will return a .vlw file. Create a file named "data" and put it in the same directory as the program. 

Or you can view it running on Processing.js at http://alvinschang.com/projects/NHLFirstRound.php
